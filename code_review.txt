One change I suggest is to use some kind of loop so the user does not have to restart the program each time they want to create or
access another file. Another change I suggest is to check that the input from the user can be converted to an int after line 34 to
prevent a NumberFormatException from being thrown. I also suggest checking after line 56 that the personâ€™s name entered by the user
does not contain any slash symbols as this will cause an exception to be thrown when the program tries to create a file with this name.
Another suggestion I have is to check if the user input is a valid int before trying to convert it to an int on line 103. One final
change I suggest is to make sure the file number the user inputted will not cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException before trying to
get the file at that index on line 104. This code review went well. There were a lot of good things about this project and there were
not too many problems that I could find.
